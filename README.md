<h1>Algorithm for file updates in Python
</h1>


<h2>Project Description</h2>
As a healthcare company's security professional, I regularly update a file to manage employee access to restricted content based on their IP addresses. This involves maintaining an allow list of permitted IP addresses for the restricted subnetwork and a remove list for employees who should be excluded. I'm tasked with creating a Python algorithm to check for matches between the remove list and the allow list, and removing any corresponding IP addresses from the file. This ensures the integrity and security of our network access.

<h2>Python functions, elements, and concepts used:</h2>

- open(): A built-in function used to open files.
- .read(): A method that reads the contents of a file or file-like object.
- .split(): A method that splits a string into a list of substrings based on a specified delimiter.
- .join(): A method that concatenates elements of an iterable into a single string using a specified separator.
- .remove(): A method that removes the first occurrence of a specified element from a list.
- with statement: A context manager that ensures proper handling of resources and automatically closes the file after use.
- File object: An object that represents a file and provides methods for reading from and writing to it.
- Strings: Used to store text data, such as the file name, file contents, and IP addresses.
- Variables: Used to store and manipulate data, such as import_file, ip_addresses, and element.
- Loops: Specifically, the for loop, which iterates over elements in a sequence.
- Conditional statements: Used to evaluate conditions, such as checking if an element is present in a list.
- File I/O (Input/Output): The process of reading from and writing to files.
- String formatting: Using special characters and syntax to format strings, such as the newline character "\n".
